# Glossary

Key terminology used throughout the GraphRAG Pipeline documentation and codebase.

## Ansible Concepts

### **Playbook**

A top-level YAML file that serves as the entry point for Ansible orchestration. It maps hosts to one or more plays.

### **Play**

A logical unit within a playbook that defines which roles and tasks are executed on a specific group of hosts.

### **Task**

The smallest actionable unit in Ansible. A task executes a specific module (e.g., `apt`, `template`) with a set of arguments.

### **Role**

A reusable collection of tasks, variables, and handlers organized in a standard directory structure.

### **FQCN**

*Fully Qualified Collection Name*. A unique identifier for Ansible modules (e.g., `ansible.builtin.copy`). The pipeline canonicalizes all module names to FQCN format.

## Pipeline Concepts

### **AST**

*Abstract Syntax Tree*. A structural representation of source code generated by a parser. We use ASTs to find relationships that simple text search would miss.

### **Tree-sitter**

A high-performance parsing library that generates ASTs. It allows the pipeline to understand the grammar of YAML, Python, and other languages.

### **GraphRAG**

*Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation*. A technique where an LLM is given structured facts from a graph database to ground its answers and minimize hallucinations.

### **MCP**

*Model Context Protocol*. An open standard that allows AI models to connect to data sources and tools (like our knowledge graph) using a unified API.

## Database Concepts

### **Node**

An entity in our Neo4j graph. Examples include a `File`, a `Task`, or a `Variable`.

### **Relationship**

A directed link between two nodes. For example, a `Task` might have a `NOTIFIES` relationship to a `Handler`.

### **Cypher**

The declarative query language used by Neo4j. It is similar to SQL but optimized for finding paths and patterns in graphs.
